AirBnB Clone (Console)
What its about
This repo contains the Base model of every object and classes in the AirBnB project not excluding the file storage.
It is a console that handles command needed for the AirBnB site. It's a dip of the toe into the ocean of AirBnB and web applications as a whole

What it does
put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
